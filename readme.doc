#componentdidmount is not equivalent to useeffect() .useEffect() does not use componentdidmount behind scene its competely new methods

# componentwillunmount is called when we are leavign page
    -lots of things we need to clear before leavin page
    -since react builds spa then functions in one component will remain there even if we change the page so we need to clean up when leaving 
        the page so we clean up in componentwillunmount
    -one example is suppose we have setInterval in componentdidmount the setinterval will be called even if we change the page

    e.g componentdidmount(){
        this.timer=setInterval(()=>{},1000);
    }

    now in componentwillunmount(){
        //this stops the timer when we leave this page
        clearInterval(this.timer);
    }
